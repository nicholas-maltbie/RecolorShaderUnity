# Recolor Shader Unity

[![Example of recolored cats with a rotating gif](Demo/imgs/Showcase-Cats.gif)](https://youtu.be/mV787RU6HWI)

This project demonstrates an example of how to use the Recolor
shader developed in Unity's Universal Render Pipeline to
recolor a grey scale image using two different colors dynamically.
I have made a video, [Custom Color Shader! Dynamic
Recoloring Explained](https://youtu.be/mV787RU6HWI), which talks
through the examples of this project and how the shader works.

This shader was developed as part of the Falling Parkour Project here -

This project is developed using Unity
[LTS Release 2021.1.19f1](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2021.1.19).
Install this version of Unity from Unity Hub using this unity hub link

## Samples

Here is a summary of the various examples in this project.
Each link provides a tutorial on how part of the shader works
and the final link shows the completed shader in action.

1. [Hello Shaders](Demo/1.HelloShaders.md)
    \- Basic Shader introduction.
2. [Colored Shaders](Demo/2.ColoredShaders.md)
    \- Create a solid color shader.
3. [Recoloring Images](Demo/3.RecoloringImages.md)
    \- Recoloring a black and white image.
4. [Combining Images](Demo/4.CombiningImages.md)
    \- Combining two images together.
5. [Final Combination](Demo/5.FinalCombination.md)
    \- Recoloring a black and white image two different colors.

After going through these tutorials, you will know how to dynamically
recolor grey scale using the shaders and materials in this project!
